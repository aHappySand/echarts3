 * (1) This method **MUST NOT be used inside echarts !!!**, unless it is prepared
 * to use user registered shapes.
 * Because the built-in shape (see `getBuiltInShape`) will be registered by
 * `registerShape` by default. That enables users to get both built-in
 * shapes as well as the shapes belonging to themsleves. But users can overwrite
 * the built-in shapes by using names like 'circle', 'rect' via calling
 * `registerShape`. So the echarts inner featrues should not fetch shapes from here
 * in case that it is overwritten by users, except that some features, like
 * `custom series`, `graphic component`, do it deliberately.
 *
 * (2) In the features like `custom series`, `graphic component`, the user input
 * `{tpye: 'xxx'}` does not only specify shapes but also specify other graphic
 * elements like `'group'`, `'text'`, `'image'` or event `'path'`. Those names
 * are reserved names, that is, if some user registers a shape named `'image'`,
 * the shape will not be used. If we intending to add some more reserved names
 * in feature, that might bring break changes (disable some existing user shape
 * names). But that case probably rarely happens. So we don't make more mechanism
 * to resolve this issue here.
